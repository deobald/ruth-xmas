"\"Spaceman!\" the shout blurted from inside the doorway.  \"My god, can they ever produce gravel when they desire\" he thought.  \"Or perhaps it's me. I am the gravel in this otherwise starling existence. Thrown into the sky and dragging them down by the wings.\"",

"They hadn't released anger and fear.  The best of them, certainly.  But that was even true before humanity chose this route.  He glanced down upon mud, rope, and wood.  Such organic comforts were worth what was about to bear.  Memories of childhood washed in, checked intellectually but emotionally evasive.",

"Dirt.  What a peculiar draw it had in his first classes, his impish fingers rubbing, absorbing through skin and nail.  His first splinter introduced him to a spectacular display: \"it's in my body! ...what if it will never come out? ...the pain! ...what if it gets worse?...\"  Years of formal education left him nearly incapable of recalling the sensation but he hadn't abandoned savage fear either, if only out of honesty.  There is a lifetime between he who knows no fear and he who controls it with a cage of piano wire.  \"A slight distraction- just a moment-\" he permitted as the thought wafted in.  \"Piano wire?\"  Was it really necessary to conjure up such an image?  Fear as an animal, sure.  But fear as rabid, fear as beast, fear as cannibal?  The picture surges.  Raving, ravaged, and raging the creature hidden under a mat of hair soaked in blood tortures itself on the wires.  Has it made this cage for itself?",

"Enough.  There will be plenty of time to daydream your morbid daydreams tomorrow.  In the daytime.  These trips come every seven years -- waste none of it.  Pin your memories of manipulating jibs in the salty breeze.  Pick them up for the flight out.  Or leave them be.  We can be certain there's nothing lost in a flight without such self-indulgent cliches.  Probably.  (Though sharper than he was wise, he knew well enough to second guess his every thought.  Or was that learned behaviour as well? . . .)",

"\"Spaceman!\" she shouted a second time, louder, despite the fact he was nearly in the door frame.  \"Think we need you, huh?  Think we need supervision?  Think we want you here?\"  Simple words came softly and expired soon after.  People weren't prone to yelling once they realized they were doing so.",

"\"Now, Sarah.  I shouldn't imagine you'd treat any other customer in such a  way this season.  Or any season!\"  A chuckle burst from the man behind Sarah, obviously bemused by a series of gentle contemplations which produced this result shortly before stumbling upon one another.  \"Come on in, Spaceman. We've got a stew on and a few rooms left.\"",

"\"Bloody evaluations\" she muttered as the men passed by, \"how are we supposed to feel about treating those who trouble our very existence with the ways of the past?\"",

"\"I'm here on vacation, Ma'am. But I certainly think the answer to that question begs for more time than we have during vestibule exchanges.\"",

"\"Have a seat then.\" she retorted gently, a smile gracing her face for the first time since he landed.  Her knuckles scooped an arc back to a chair at the heavy mahogany table.  He imagined her swimming through heavy cream with a ballerina's grace.  \"Pardon my husband's humour.  On occasion I watch him dream and ponder whether or not his subconscious isn't unnaturally drawn to rituals of old. The draw materializes as bad jokes.\"  He was suddenly aware of a number of conifers hidden in each corner of the pub.  Cupressaceae, mainly.  An odd choice, geographically.  Suppose it doesn't matter given the warmth of the inn.  \"Oh, don't be alarmed. The smell brought him in with the first and now it's our little tradition; we add a shrub each year\" explained Sarah.",

"\"No alarm here, ma'am-\"  \"Please. Call me Sarah.\"  \"No alarm here... Sarah.\"",

"\"I'm glad to hear it!  I'm also Alexey.\"  Another chuckle.",

"\"Alexey and Sarah, I'm Shin. Pleased to meet you.\"",

"Trivialities didn't last long and questions of origin were among the only truly banal conversation pieces.  Shin was not surprised to find that Sarah had a significantly more confused bloodline.  It did come as a bit of a shock that Alexey came by his name honestly.  A Russian with traced unmixed blood would himself become a conversation piece when Shin returned.  The choice of his ancestors to avoid other races was almost troubling.  Shin's beginnings were of interest to neither of his hosts.  They knew how he began and how he would end.",

"\"And so. The question of my ways...?\"",

"\"Oh, that.  I didn't mean anything by it.  A little pent-up defensiveness, Shin.  I'm certain you're unfamiliar with the emotion but know I'm sorry you were on the receiving end.  Heck.  I'd be sorry if you were here for an evaluation.\"",

"\"So would I\" Shin offered with a grimace.  \"I'm not a husk, you know.  A life of Science belies a life of Man.\"",

"\"Poetry!\" Alexey sputtered as he strained himself across the table to satisfy cups already near the brim.  \"O, whiche offensse such as thys bringeth ae graeter bountie oof thae sweete riweres de satisfacion!\"  A guffaw, this time.",

"\"How many dead languages do you need to butcher to poke fun at our friend, Alexey?  He's no more permitted art by the Universities than we permit ourselves.\"",

"\"I paint\" he offered again, thinking to himself that soon enough he'd need to come up with something of worthy exchange for the wine and warmth.",

"\"And is there a muse in the void, Spaceman?  Is there chi in the vacuum?  Do the other stars have each their own soul?\"",

"\"If I didn't know better, I'd swear it was a string of your insincerity lain before me, Sarah!\"  He flushed.  Such outbursts were the product of wine, not careful consideration.",

"\"Then let it be\" chimed her husband before she bothered to respond.  \"Perhaps it does not exist as such until willingly received.\"",

"The flush persisted well beyond his apology.  \"Forgive me. I'm not accustomed to wine.\"  The cup splashed on the table as he hurried the remains down his throat.  He focused on the vegetables in his stew while Alexey extended himself to replenish the vessel with a grin.",

"After a pause to reel in a catch of roots from the warm pond beneath his chin he broke the silence with renewed, topical earnest.  \"I read your tribe were among the most peaceful. I'm not sure I understand the source of this anxiety.\"",

"\"What could be more anxious than three monkeys slurping down rutabaga like they'd never seen one before?\"",

"He wasn't even sure who said it.  Frustration frothed within him as he tried to recount all he'd read in preparation for the trip.  Riddles?  Jokes?  What sort of response would satisfy?  He wanted nothing more than to be foil they demanded, but gosh!  Monkeys?  Honestly?  Was he simply so unlucky as to have stumbled upon the few remaining believers in the superstitious sciences?  They even had the Pagan trees, for crying out loud.  No vehicles, no weapons.  No communication but voice and touch.  No desires but to eat stew and play word games.  No progress.  No development!  No discoveries!  No understanding.  What did these people know about the world?  Nothing.  The world provides stew.  Stew for hairless monkeys who polish wood and feed the neighborhood dog that which they wouldn't eat themselves.  Had he ever seen a raw rutabaga?  Can't they see who they are?  Can't they see what they're doing?  Aren't they frustrated by the delta between the truth and who they claim to be?",

"\"We aren't bloody monkeys.\"",

"\"Surely sweet Shin shouldn't stay so surly in Space?\" Sarah cooed.",

"\"Now who's being poetic?\"  Shin stood up, a new flush in his face.  Why were they still grinning?  Wasn't this aggravating for either of them?  He wasn't sure what to make of all this.  There were no such attacks at any of the stations.  Just politics and research.  Without stew or rope.",

"Right.  While looking down on his hosts the childish expressions finally made sense in the fog of the wine.",

"The wine!  He reached across the table and overflowed their cups, a happy grimace hugging his entire face, before bringing the bottle to his lips."
